## 🧭 Overview
Betezen.Fun introduces a new type of prediction market: **perpetual, decentralized, and based on economic fundamentals**.
Users can trade tokenized representations of country performance — going long or short — based on indicators like inflation, GDP growth, stock indices, and exchange rates.
These contracts never expire, allowing positions to be held as long as desired.

Unlike traditional prediction markets where users bet on binary outcomes, 
Betezen.Fun quantifies macroeconomic predictions into tradable indices. 
For example, instead of predicting "Will interest rates rise?", traders can go 
long or short on a rate index that reflects central bank decisions. This turns 
policy speculation into an on-chain asset.

## 😵 Problem We Are Solving
- ⏳ Expiring prediction markets limit long-term forecasting.
- 💸 High liquidation risk on leveraged positions.
- 🧩 No financial product for directly trading macro trends of countries.
- 🌐 Prediction markets too focused on events, not economic fundamentals.

---

## 💡 Solution
We introduce Perpetual Country Positions, where traders can:
- 📈 Open long/short positions on countries based on real indicators.
- 🌀 Keep positions perpetually — no expiry.
- ⚖️ Avoid full liquidations — positions decay over time, not explode.
- 🤝 Trade with transparent funding fees and no centralized intermediaries.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. CountryScore Calculation
   Based on CPI, GDP, Stock Index, Exchange Rate via oracle.
2. Position Contracts
   Users open long or short using openPosition(), and can set takeProfit/stopLoss.
3. Funding Fee Model
   Balances incentives between longs/shorts.
4. Profit/Loss Sharing
   All handled by smart contracts — no need to trust us.
